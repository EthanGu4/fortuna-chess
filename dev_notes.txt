If you have an error related to flashes or pulses appearing BELOW squares,
in the css file make sure to add a #fantasy-gameboard to ensure that the z-index is
referenced based on other objects in the gameboard.

!! PIECES HAVE ACTIVE AND PASSIVE ABILITIES !!

TO-DO:
- Finish creative process of determining piece attributes and piece abilities
- Code them and add appropriate css for stylish purposes
- Fix the callback() and playerTurn dilemna when calling an ability, right now it calls instantly, which can cause some abilities to malfunction
- Add moving logic (this can happen later)
- Figure out board layout, where pieces can sit optimally
- Figure out whole checkGameStatus, since right now it only works for the classic-gameboard

WARNING:
- watch out for overflow: hidden it can cover a lot of the css and make some of the effects hidden behind the squares
FOUDN THE ISSUE ITS LITERALLY CUZ I APPLIED TO THE PIECE RATHER THAN THE SQUAREA HAHAHAFHOAEFHOIA

bruh wtf is going on...
